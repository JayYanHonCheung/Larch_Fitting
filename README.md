# Larch_Fitting
 
Please don't upload all 9000 spectra on github.


"""
Plan

1. Organise Cu Standard scripts. (Done)
2. Larch fit data_1 of 9. (Done)
3. Organise script for data_1. (Done)
4. Simultaneous fit of data 2 - 9 w/ script. (Done)
5. Compare results with Artemis and Larch (if sigma2 optimised as constrain.) (Not important)
6. Improve fitting by rebinning either in time-axis or EXAFS region. (Didn't work so well.)
7. Improve fitting by cropping and recalibrating all 9000 spectra in DAWN (in LARCH in the future).
8. Fit all 9000 spectra.
9. Adaptive method to choose Cu-Cu and/or Cu-O.
10. Decide fitting parameters: dk, rbkg, dr, etc.
11. Fix double normalisation issue. (Done, kinda worked around)
12. Maybe different e0, or calibrate properly.
13. Find/create suitable feff model (Hao's suggestion).
14. Rebin energy axis in larch. 
15. Read .nxs file as time series, instead of individual file at each time.
16. Improvise, Adapt, Overcome.
